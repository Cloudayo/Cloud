<p>Cloud computing is a term that refers to the delivery of computing services, 
  such as storage, networking, analytics, and more, over the internet. 
  Instead of running these services on physical servers or devices, organizations can access them through the cloud, 
  paying only for the resources they use on a pay-as-you-go basis.</p>
